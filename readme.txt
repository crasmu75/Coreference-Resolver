This program was tested on lab1-26.eng.utah.edu

Since the specifications for the handin on this assignment were a little bit vague, the bash file that runs our coreference resolver takes the 2 command line arguments and will execute our program from there.  If they are not supplied the scripts will display the usage instead of trying to run the program.
